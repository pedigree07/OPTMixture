This repository has R codes for Sampling-based Gaussian Mixture Regression for Big Data by JooChul Lee, Elizabeth D. Schifano, and HaiYing Wang.

Datageneration.R generate simulated data

Subsampling.R calculate estimates (coefficients, variances and component weights) based on the optima subsampling probabilities

Example.R provides an example how to perform estimates with the above codes and a simulated data
